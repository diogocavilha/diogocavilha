## Hello! ðŸ‘‹
My name is Diogo Cavilha and I live in Brazil.  
I'm a Backend engineer who loves creating and testing new ways of getting the job done.

- I'm skilled in PHP, Python and NodeJS.
- I have also some experience with Go and Java.
- Iâ€™m currently working fully remote for a company from SÃ£o Paulo as a senior backend engineer. Currently working by using Python and NodeJS for creating and maintaining microservices.

Feel free to get in touch! :blush:
