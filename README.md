## Hello! ðŸ‘‹
My name is Diogo Cavilha and I live in Brazil.  
I'm a software engineer who loves creating and testing new ways of getting the job done.

- I love Linux and Shell Script! :heart_eyes:
- I'm skilled in PHP, Node.js, Python and ReactJS though I have also some experience with other programming languages such as Java (with Spring Boot).
- Iâ€™m currently working fully remote as a senior backend engineer, creating and maintaining microservices running as serverless apps on AWS.

Feel free to get in touch! :blush:
