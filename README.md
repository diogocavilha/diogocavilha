## Hello! ðŸ‘‹
My name is Diogo Cavilha and I live in Brazil.  
I'm a Back end engineer who loves creating and testing new ways of getting the job done.

- Iâ€™m currently working fully remote to a company from another state of Brazil.
- I'm currently learning lots of things about Java, Kotlin, Python and a bit of Go.
- I love Linux and shellscripts!

Feel free to get in touch! :blush:
