## Hello! ðŸ‘‹
My name is Diogo Cavilha and I live in Brazil.  
I'm a Backend engineer who loves creating and testing new ways of getting the job done.

- I love Linux and Shellscript! :heart_eyes:
- I'm skilled in PHP and have a good experience with Python.
- I have also some experience with Java, kotlin and Go.
- Iâ€™m currently working fully remote for a company from SÃ£o Paulo as a senior backend python engineer. Currently working by using Flask Framework for creating and maintaining microservices.

Feel free to get in touch! :blush:
